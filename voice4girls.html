    <p><i><font color="aqua"><font size="7">THE PROBLEM</font></font></i><br>
        <div id="prblm"><i>India is home to over 113 million adolescent girls. Only 30% of them graduate from Class 10. Almost 50% are married before the legal age of 18.<br>
       
       Deeply entrenched traditional expectations, fears, social norms and poverty exclude many girls in India from critical knowledge about health, safety and rights.<br>
        Without relevant information, girls find themselves unable to make decisions, advocate for themselves, or take control of their own futures.<br>
        These marginalized girls are more likely to perpetuate cycles of poverty and social inequality in their communities.</i><br></div>
       
     <i><font color="aqua"><font size="7">SOLUTION</font></font></i><br>
     <div id="solns"><i>VOICE 4 Girls believes that given knowledge and agency, an adolescent girl can advocate for herself and her family, stay in school and delay marriage.<br> 
       
       VOICE is a social enterprise that enables marginalized adolescent girls in India to re-imagine their identities, capabilities and futures.<br> 
       We conduct activity-based camps[2] where girls acquire critical knowledge, spoken English and life skills while they grow in confidence and self efficacy.<br>
        VOICE camps are run by trained college students who act as role models and mentor to the campers — students in government and low-cost[3] private schools.<br>
         Our goal is to reach enough girls in India to impact national level indicators — retention in school, child marriage and health.</i><br></div>
       
      <i><font color="aqua"><font size="7">IMPACT</font></font></i><br>
      <div id="imp"><i>Since 2011, VOICE camps have directly reached out to more than 14,000 campers in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Uttarakhand; and impacted almost 55,000 girls indirectly.<br>
        VOICE conducts pre and post camp assessments to evaluate levels of learning and empowerment indicators.<br>
         Our quantitative and qualitative studies have shown that girls are more confident and invested in their education, futures and communities after camp.<br>
VOICE was founded in Hyderabad, India in May 2011 and is registered as a trust under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882.<br>
 Over the last three years, VOICE has built strong partnerships to reach campers.<br>
  Our partners include Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV), Social Welfare and Tribal Welfare Residential Schools in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh,<br>
   Grey Matters Capital and the Uttaranchal Association of North America (UANA) among others.</i></div></p>
