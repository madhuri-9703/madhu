        <p style="color: aquamarine;"><font size="6"><i><center>Osmania University is named after its founder,<br> 
            Nawab Osman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam of Hyderabad <br>who rather through a farman or Royal Charter,
            <br> brought the University into existence in 1917.<br> It is the seventh oldest in the Country and third 
            oldest in South India.<br> Though the need for the University for the Hyderabad State was felt, both by the intelligentia
             and <br>the people for a long time, the initiative came from a civil servant, Sir Akbar Hydari, who was then the
              Home Secretary to the State Government.<br> Sir Hydari, in a memorandum to the Education Minister in Early 1917,<br> 
              emphasized the need to establish a University of Hyderabad with 'Urdu' as the medium of instruction<br> 
              "as it is the language of the widest currency in India, official language of the State, and it is a language
               which is understood by a <br>vast majority of the population of the State." He believed that higher education<br>
                must have its foundations deep in national consciousness.</center></font></i></p></div><br>
