    <center><h1>GENERATION</h1></center>
    <p><font color="white">The age differences in political attitudes and voting choices in the past three election cycles have been driven by three broad social and political trends. The first is
         the growing racial and ethnic diversity of the country, reflected in the rising percentage of non-whites among younger age cohorts. 
        Non-whites have been far more supportive of the Democratic Party in the last several decades. Among members of the Silent generation today, 79% are non-Hispanic whites;
         among the Millennial generation, just 59% are non-Hispanic whites.

        A second factor is the political environment experienced by successive generations as they have come of age politically. 
        The relative popularity of the president and the two major political parties at the time an individual turns 18 has clear consequences for their voting preference
        s in subsequent elections.
        
        A third factor is the broader societal changes that occur within a generation’s life cycle. These changes have a bigger impact
         on the political views of younger people, who are still in the process of forming opinions. Older people are more likely to reflect the values prevalent when they were
          growing up. The greater acceptance of homosexuality and interracial dating among young people than older ones today are examples of this.</font></p>

          <div id="mom"><h3><i>generation change of mothers</i></h3>
          <p><ul><li>In their hands we grow up, through their eyes we see the world; their cradle teaches us to swing in the real world.<br></li>
             <li>A mother has the power of not only raising her child but also the power to correct the wrongs in her child.<br></li>
                <li>In every corner of the world a child looks for teaching, safety, hope and love in one person, their mother.<br></li>
                <li> She is the first being who teaches you; be it through academia or through personal understanding; <br></li>
                <li>  she will try to save her child from the darkness in this world by enabling him to tackle it with good. <br></li>
                    <li>There is nothing in this world which a child can do to repay the debt he acquires to his mother.<br></li>
                        <li>Every day she showers him with love and knowledge of the world without any expectation. She does it with all of her <br>children without any hesitation or want of return.</li>
                            <li>This article will focus on why it is paramount to educate our mothers and also how it can be done.</li></ul></p>

             <div id="dad"><h4><i>generation change of fathers</i></h4>
             <p><ul><li>Fathers (and father figures) make a vital contribution to their children’s development.<br></li>
                <li>What fathers have to offer their children is different from what mothers offer, but it is just as important to the child.<br></li> 
                    <li>The differences between men and women as parents are not laid down for us – each family discovers them in its own way.<br></li>
                        <li>Fathers also matter because they are important to their partners. Their parents’ relationship is the model of relating that children take on board,<br></li>
                            <li>so the success or failure of their own future relationships will be deeply influenced by how their parents manage things. That is not to say that parents have <br>to be perfect. </li>
                                <li> But it is important for children to see their parents working together to try to sort out the difficulties that every family face from time to time.</li>/</li></p>
